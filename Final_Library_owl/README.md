Here I've created c3p0 pool to manage database connection.
On local database that's code ia enough, but when I try to connect the same way to Database on Heroku, some problems occured
I think there some links between versions, Java 6 and 7, and some properties, but I don't want to work with that, because it's too old technologies
It would be a lot of troubles to solve this problem and there is no efficient benefit.
That's why that project has only code here and doesn't have deployment on Heroku
